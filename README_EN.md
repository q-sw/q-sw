## Who am I?

I am a **Lead SRE** at [S3NS](www.s3ns.io). S3NS is a joint venture between **Thales** and **Google**.
My team and I are responsible for maintaining a multi-tenant platform based on **Kubernetes**.

My main activities revolve around automation, Infrastructure as Code, and developing tools to make my (our) lives easier. As a Lead, I spend a lot of time writing and updating our documentation.

Moreover, in my spare time, I lecture at [CESI](www.cesi.fr) (engineering school), to share my knowledge on Cloud, DevOps and SRE topics.
